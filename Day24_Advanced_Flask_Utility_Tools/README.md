Day 24 – Advanced Flask Utility Tools

Today’s collection focuses on building practical, real-world mini-apps using Flask — tools that automate tasks, process data, and bring API-style functionality into simple projects.

New Concepts Covered

1. Text Summarization Logic

  Reduces long text into short key points using basic keyword extraction.

2. URL Hashing

  Converts long URLs into short, unique codes for easy sharing.

3. Data Visualization Basics

  Uses simple dictionary structures to prepare data for charts.

4. Web Scraping

  Fetching live product prices from a website using requests + BeautifulSoup.

5. Reminder API Logic

  Creating an endpoint that returns reminders dynamically.

Programs Overview

1. AI-Style Text Summarizer

 Concept: Simple keyword-based summarization.
 What it does: Accepts long text and returns a short, meaningful summary.

2. Simple URL Shortener

 Concept: URL hashing using random ID generation.
 What it does: Converts a long URL into a short code and allows redirection.

3. Expense Visualizer

 Concept: Handling and structuring data for visualization.
 What it does: Accepts expense categories + amounts and prepares chart-ready data.

4. Product Price Watcher

 Concept: Basic web scraping.
 What it does: Fetches the current price of a product from a webpage and displays it.

5. Notification Reminder API

 What it does: Sends a custom reminder when a user hits the route.

HTML Files

1. summarizer.html

  Simple form to input long text and display the summarized output.

2. shortener.html

  Takes a URL from the user and displays the generated short link.

3. expenses.html

  Collects category + amount and shows the processed result.

4. price_watcher.html

  User enters product URL → displays current fetched price.

5. reminder.html

  Displays the reminder message returned by the API endpoint.
