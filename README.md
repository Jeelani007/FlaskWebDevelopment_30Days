FlaskWebDev_30Days — 30 Days of Flask Web Development

This repository documents my daily progress as I learn, build, and refine real-world web applications step by step.

Purpose
  > The aim of this challenge is to understand how web development works from the ground up using Flask.  
  > Each day introduces a new concept — from simple routes to database integration and full project deployment.

What’s Inside
 Every folder represents one day’s progress and includes:
   - A practical Flask program  
   - Clean, organized code structure  
   - A short note or README explaining the day’s focus  

Phase 1: Flask Basics (Days 1–5)

  Learn the core of Flask and build your first interactive pages.
  Topics: Setup, Routing, Templates, Static Files, Forms.

Phase 2: Flask Features (Days 6–10)

  Explore Flask’s core features for real-world apps.
  Topics: Request/Response, Sessions, Error Handling, Blueprints.

Phase 3: Databases (Days 11–15)

  Work with databases and build a small CRUD app.
  Topics: SQLite, SQLAlchemy, Flask-Migrate, Mini Notes App.

 Phase 4: REST APIs (Days 16–20)
 
  Build modern APIs and secure them with authentication.
  Topics: Flask-RESTful, CRUD API, JWT Authentication.

Phase 5: Real-World Features (Days 21–25)

  Integrate external tools and improve your app.
