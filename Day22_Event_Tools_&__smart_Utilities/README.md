Day 22 – Event Tools & Smart Utilities in Flask

Today’s tasks focused on building small but useful Flask applications that interact with user input, process data, and display dynamic results. All programs are lightweight, beginner-friendly, and fully unique.

Concepts Covered

  * Dynamic Routing – Handling user requests with different URL paths.

  * Form Handling (GET/POST) – Receiving data from HTML inputs.

  * Data Processing in Flask – Performing calculations, filters, and formatting.

  * Template Rendering – Passing results from Python to HTML.

  * Basic Utility Logic – Scheduling, filtering, searching, and converting text.

Programs Overview

1️. Event Scheduler

Concept: Date/time handling & simple scheduling logic.
What it does: Takes an event name + date from the user and returns how many days are left for the event.

2️. Calorie Tracker

Concept: Form processing & simple math operations.
What it does: Lets the user enter food items and calorie counts; shows the total calories consumed.

3️. Quote Search

Concept: Filtering lists based on keywords.
What it does: Has a small collection of quotes and displays the ones that match the user’s search word.

4️. Image Caption Viewer

Concept: Dynamic variable passing to templates.
What it does: Shows a set of images and displays a caption when the user selects one.

5️. Simple Translator

Concept: Dictionary-based word mapping.
What it does: Takes a word from the user and shows translation (e.g., EN → simple predefined translations).

HTML File Descriptions

1. schedule.html

 Collects event name and date; displays remaining days.

2. calories.html

 Form to add foods and calories; shows total calorie count.

3. quote_search.html

 Input box to search quotes and section to display matching results.

4. image_viewer.html

 Shows a dropdown or buttons for images; displays selected caption.

5. translate.html

  Simple text input for entering a word; displays its translation.

Summary

  > Learned to create practical mini-tools in Flask.

  > Handled form data and displayed processed results.

  > Used templates to show dynamic outputs.
