Day 18 – Flask Data Utilities & Mini Tools

Focused on creating small but useful Flask tools that work with text, numbers, and simple data processing. Each program introduces a new idea while still remaining beginner-friendly.

Concepts Covered

1. Text Transformation

 You learned how to take user input from a form, process the text, and show the result back on the screen.

2. Basic Calculations in Flask

 We used Python logic inside Flask routes to perform simple operations like counting, reversing, or converting.

3. Handling Lists & Processing Data

 Programs demonstrated how Flask can store small lists in memory and use them in simple applications.

4. Using Templates for Output

 Each tool sent results to an HTML page using Jinja ({{ }}) placeholders.


Programs You Created Today

1. Text Reverser

Concept: String manipulation + sending results to template
What it does: Takes a sentence and returns the reversed text.

2. Character Frequency Counter

Concept: Dictionary counting + form handling
What it does: Counts how many times each character appears in the given text.

3. Simple Unit Converter

Concept: Basic numeric conversion
What it does: Converts kilometers to miles instantly and shows the result.

4. Word Shuffler

Concept: List splitting + random shuffle
What it does: Takes a sentence, shuffles the words, and displays a fun mixed version.

5. Lucky Number Generator

Concept: Random number generation
What it does: Shows a random “lucky number” every time the user clicks generate.
