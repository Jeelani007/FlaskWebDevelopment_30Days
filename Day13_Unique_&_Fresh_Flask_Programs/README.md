Day 13 – Utility Tools in Flask (Random & Interactive Programs)

Leraned building small but powerful utility tools using Flask.
Each program is interactive and uses Python logic + HTML forms to create fun, useful, and fully unique mini-apps.

These types of apps help improve your understanding of:

  * Handling user input

  * Generating dynamic results

  * Using Python functions inside Flask views

  * Sending results back to the browser

New Concepts Learned Today

 > Random Module

   We used Python’s random module to generate quotes, colors, and usernames.
   It helps create unpredictable dynamic output.

 > Form Handling

   Each HTML file uses a simple <form> to send user input to Flask using GET or POST.

 > data → process → result flow

  Basic structures of apps

   1. User enters something

   2. Flask processes it

   3. The HTML page shows the result


Basic String Processing

  > Used string slicing and comparison for palindrome checking.

Utility Web Apps

  > All programs today are small tools that give instant output — perfect for learning fast responses in Flask apps.

Programs Overview

File	Description

 1. random_quote.py	Shows a random motivational quote each time the user loads the page.

 2. bmi_calculator.py	Takes height & weight → calculates BMI → shows result category.

 3. color_generator.py	Produces a fully random color in HEX format.
 
 4. palindrome_checker.py	Checks whether a word is a palindrome.

 5. username_generator.py	Creates a fun random username using name + random numbers.


HTML File Descriptions

 > quote.html	Displays a randomly chosen quote.

 > bmi.html	Simple form for entering height and weight + shows BMI result.

 > color.html	Shows a random HEX color + background preview.

 > palindrome.html	Lets users input a word and see if it’s a palindrome.

 > username.html	Input name → get a random username suggestion.
